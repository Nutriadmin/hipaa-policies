# 4. Risk Management Policy

This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of NutriAdmin's information security risk management process. The risk management process is intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its mission.

## 4.1 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) - HIPAA Security Rule Risk Analysis
* 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) - HIPAA Security Rule Risk Management
* 164.308(a)(8) - HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation

## 4.2 Risk Management Policies

1. It is the policy of NutriAdmin to conduct thorough and timely risk assessments of the potential threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) (and other confidential and proprietary electronic information) it stores, transmits, and/or processes for its Customers and to develop strategies to efficiently and effectively mitigate the risks identified in the assessment process as an integral part of the NutriAdmin's information security program.
2. Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of NutriAdmin's compliance program and information security program in accordance with the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B), 164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).
   1. Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:
   2. Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to NutriAdmin physical safeguards; and
      * These changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the NutriAdmin Platform.
   3. While making changes to NutriAdmin physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations.
   4. NutriAdmin performs yearly technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.
3. NutriAdmin implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:
   1. Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI NutriAdmin receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;
   2. Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer ePHI;
   3. Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer ePHI that are not permitted or required; and
   4. Ensure compliance by all workforce members.
4. Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and NutriAdmin's Security Officer.
5. All NutriAdmin workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as outlined in the NutriAdmin Roles Policy.
6. The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of NutriAdmin's Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.
7. All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.
8. The details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment, discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:
    1. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management Procedures by creating a Task in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet with ID #CRA-6.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the Risk Management Procedures.
    3. All findings are documented in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet.
    4. Once the Risk Management Procedures are complete, along with corresponding documentation, the Security Officer marks the Task as Closed, adding any pertinent notes required.
    5. The Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a yearly basis using the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet to assess compliance with above policy. This monitoring activity is recorded using ID #CRA-7

## 4.3 Risk Management Procedures

### 4.3.1 Risk Assessment

The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.

NutriAdmin carries a thorough risk assessment using HealthIT.gov's Security Risk Assessment Tool. The following two links explain more in detail what is this tool:
* [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/guidance-risk-analysis/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/guidance-risk-analysis/index.html)
* [https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/security-risk-assessment-tool](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/security-risk-assessment-tool)

This tool is a software application jointly launched by The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The application guides the user (NutriAdmin team) through a step-by-step questionnaire that covers sources of risk exhaustively. 

### 4.3.2 Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of NutriAdmin Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.

After conducting a Risk Assessment, any identified risks will be discussed by NutriAdmin's management team. If considered appropriate and reasonable, tasks will be designed to address any potential risks. This may include development work, policy design, training, etc.

Where an identified risk is considered to be low impact, low probability and/or too impractical/unreasonable to mitigate, this decision will be documented after discussion of the level of risk.

### 4.3.3 Risk Management Schedule

The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of NutriAdmin's information security program:

* Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of NutriAdmin's information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the development process.
* Throughout a System's Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.
* As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect NutriAdmin's Platform.

## 4.4 Process Documentation

Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.
