# 3. Policy Management Policy

NutriAdmin implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all NutriAdmin workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.1 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
* 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain NutriAdmin compliance with HIPAA, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similar to source code control.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to NutriAdmin's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by NutriAdmin management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
    1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by recording an entry in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet with ID #CRA-1.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current NutriAdmin policies ([https://nutriadmin.com/policy/](https://nutriadmin.com/policy/)).
    3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented automatically in the version control system for the policies repository.
    4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer adds an entry to the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet marking the task as Done. Any relevant notes are added in the spreadsheet.
    5. Policy review is monitored on a yearly basis using the Azure DevOps Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet to assess compliance with above policy. This monitoring activity is recorded using ID #CRA-2. 
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. NutriAdmin employees may request changes to policies using the following process:
    1. The NutriAdmin employee initiates a policy Change Request by sending an email detailing the proposed change to the Security Officer or to the Privacy Officer. 
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy Change Request.
    3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Change Request. If the Change Request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
    4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer implements the Change Request to the policy or assigns an authorized employee to publish the changes. The Security Officer or Privacy officer may add any pertinent notes required.
    5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel.
    6. The Security Officer documents the request, changes, and relevant notes in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet with ID #CRA-3.
4. All policies are made accessible to all NutriAdmin workforce members. The current master policies are published at [https://nutriadmin.com/policy](https://nutriadmin.com/policy).
   * The Security Officer communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience plus a link to the Github repository where the employees can see the changes in detail.
5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later
   1. Version history of all NutriAdmin policies is done via GitHub.
   2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Microsoft's Azure DevOps.
7. NutriAdmin tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results at [https://nutriadmin.com/hipaa](https://nutriadmin.com/hipaa). In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, NutriAdmin uses the following process to track HIPAA audits, both full and interim:
    1. The Security Officer initiates the HIPAA audit activity by recording an entry in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet with ID #CRA-4.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the HIPAA activity.
    3. Once the HIPAA activity is completed, the Security Officer records an entry in the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet marking the task as done, adding any pertinent notes required.
    5. Compliance with annual compliance assessments is monitored on a yearly basis using the Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Spreadsheet to assess compliance with above policy. This monitoring activity is recorded using ID #CRA-5.

Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in [ยง5.3.1](#5.3-security-officer).
