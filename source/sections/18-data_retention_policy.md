# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, NutriAdmin understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, NutriAdmin is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, NutriAdmin has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for NutriAdmin Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws
